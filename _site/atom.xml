			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Please allow me to briefly introduce myself and my very first blog (making me fashionably late to the party).&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a Northern Californian living in New York City as a recent college graduate working as a web developer.  &amp;#8220;For whom?&amp;#8221; you might ask.  &amp;#8220;For &lt;a href=&quot;rga&quot;&gt;R/GA&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; I would then answer, &amp;#8220;mostly on &lt;a href=&quot;bball&quot;&gt;NikeBasketball.com&lt;/a&gt;, but I could be for you too if there&amp;#8217;s mutual interest &amp;#8212; please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:scott-at-dotcom-after-appden&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; anytime.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m somewhat of a JavaScript junkie.  When I don&amp;#8217;t feel like doing anything else, I just open up the latest version of &lt;a href=&quot;mootools&quot;&gt;MooTools&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;jquery&quot;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;, or anything else interesting, and just read for anything that I might not already understand.  The reasons why I love JavaScript so much are deserving of many future posts, so I won&amp;#8217;t spill the beans on that quite yet.  Sometimes it feels like every day I&amp;#8217;m learning or seeing something interesting in JavaScript or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;, so this will be my new outlet for sharing those juicy tidbits of knowledge to whomever is listening.  There will also a smattering of (hopefully) insightful commentary and opinion on whatever is new in the tech world, probably mostly Apple related due to my strong fruit company bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to my yapping, this site will host my soon-to-be-beta Mac video conversion and tagging utility, which currently is &lt;em lang=&quot;la&quot;&gt;sine nomine&lt;/em&gt;, as well as my MooTools and jQuery plugins.  A small portfolio would be nice too, we&amp;#8217;ll see.  I suspect that if you&amp;#8217;re reading this, then I&amp;#8217;ve already written a number of posts, maybe one of which you found interesting, which led you to read back into my archives.  For that, I must say, &amp;#8220;Thank you for your interest.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I had to start things off with a cheesy title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;
